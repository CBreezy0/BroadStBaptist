      <h2>Missions & Outreach Ministry</h2>
      <p>God calls us to "go and make disciples of all nations," and our Missions & Outreach Ministry answers that call locally and globally. We partner with churches and relief organizations overseas, support a network of urban ministries in our city, and organize service projects that meet practical needs in our community. Whether you feel led to give, go, or pray, there's a place for you in our mission.</p>
