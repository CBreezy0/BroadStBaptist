        <h2>Celebrating Your Faith Journey</h2>
        <p>Baptism is one of the most significant steps in a believer's faith journey. It's a public declaration of your personal relationship with Jesus Christ and your commitment to follow Him. At Broad Street, we're honored to help you take this important step of obedience.</p>

          <h3>Biblical Significance</h3>
          <p>Baptism is not just a church traditionâ€”it's a biblical command that Jesus Himself followed and instructed His followers to observe. Scripture teaches us about the importance and meaning of this sacred act:</p>
          
          <div class="scripture-verse">
            <p><em>"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."</em></p>
            <cite>Romans 6:4 KJV</cite>
          </div>
          
          <div class="baptism-meaning">
            <h4>What Baptism Represents:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Death to Sin:</strong> Going under the water symbolizes dying to your old life of sin</li>
              <li><strong>Burial with Christ:</strong> Being submerged represents being buried with Christ</li>
              <li><strong>Resurrection:</strong> Coming up out of the water symbolizes your new life in Christ</li>
              <li><strong>Public Declaration:</strong> It's your public testimony of faith before the church and community</li>
