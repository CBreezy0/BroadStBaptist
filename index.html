        <h3>Greetings From Pastor Rick (Rickey) Owens</h3>
        <p>It is with a great sense of joy, excitement and faith that I say hello to all of my Christian friends! The words are truly inexpressible as I attempt to convey to you the deep sense of thanksgiving for this providential promotion that God through Jesus has bestowed upon me for being selected as the new pastor of Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church!</p>
        
        <p>God has engendered within me what I believe are exciting and innovative ideas on how together, we can work collaboratively and harmoniously to advance a promising agenda for the church and the comprehensive community that we serve. These ideas include plans for church growth in all areas of ministry such as youth and young adults, peer mentoring, promotions and public relations, economic development, affordable housing, educational projects and most certainly neighborhood revitalization and personal empowerment initiatives!</p>
        
        <p><em>"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."</em> We know that some plant, some water, and some cultivate, but truly it is God through Jesus who gives the increase!</p>
        
        <p class="signature">Yours In Christ,<br><strong>Pastor Rick (Rickey) Owens</strong></p>
