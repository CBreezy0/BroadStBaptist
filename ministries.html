          <p>Welcome to our Children's Ministry, where we believe the next generation of Christ-followers matters deeply.

          <h3>Student Ministry (Middle & High School)</h3>
          <p>Students in grades 6–12 are invited to plug into a vibrant community built on faith, fun, and real talk. Our worship services mix live music, spoken word, and small-group discussions addressing the challenges teenagers face today. Throughout the year we host retreats, mission trips, and service days that help students grow closer to Christ and one another.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."</em></p>

          <h3>Care Ministry</h3>
          <p>The Care Ministry extends Christ's compassion to those in need—both inside our church family and beyond. We visit the sick, provide meals for those in transition or crisis, and offer prayer teams before and after each weekend service. If you're facing a hardship or would like to serve on a care team, we'd love to connect you with the support you need or the hands to help carry others' burdens.</p>
