      <h2>Care Ministry</h2>
      <!-- UPDATE MINISTRY DESCRIPTION AS NEEDED -->
      <p>The Care Ministry extends Christ's compassion to those in needâ€”both inside our church family and beyond. We visit the sick, provide meals for those in transition or crisis, and offer prayer teams before and after each weekend service. If you're facing a hardship or would like to serve on a care team, we'd love to connect you with the support you need or the hands to help carry others' burdens.</p>
