        <h3>Our Beginning (1878-1909)</h3>
        <p>All things have a beginning and so it was with Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church. There is no official written record of eventful history of the Church. All memories come from older members. With no money to build a Church a man by the name of Mr. Felix Mudd (a white man) gave a small frame house to some people who worked for him. They were Mr. Felix Hawkins, Mr. John Umbles, Mr. M. Mayfield, Mrs. Anna Bradford, and Mrs. Lou Brown.</p>
        
        <p>In 1878, the Spring Street Baptist Church was organized and was located where the Elyton School now stands. In 1906 Elyton Elementary School was built on the lot adjoining the Church. The Courthouse which was located in Elyton burned down. The land to build the Church was donated by the Elyton Land Company and the bricks from the Courthouse were donated to build the Church. In 1909 the Church was moved to its present location and renamed the Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church.</p>
        
        <h3>Reverend J. H. Holmes Era (1920-1958)</h3>
        <p>On July 7, 1920 Reverend J. H. Holmes accepted the Pastorate of Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church. Through his spiritual guidance and leadership, the Church and community were blessed. The mortgage was liquidated. In 1934 the Church was remodeled with cedar pews installed and carpet placed on the floors. On October 27, 1957 a Hammond Organ was installed. On February 5, 1958 Rev. Holmes was called home by the Lord.</p>
        
        <h3>Reverend Solomon Crenshaw Sr. Era (1959-2009)</h3>
        <p>On July 8, 1958 Reverend William C. Cunningham was called and he served until September 16, 1959. The Reverend Solomon Crenshaw, Sr. succeeded Reverend Cunningham. This dynamic young minister quickly grasped the job that lay ahead of him and proved himself equal to the important task.</p>
        
        <p>Under Reverend Crenshaw's leadership the Church building went through a great transformation. The tall ceiling was lowered and acoustical ceiling was installed. The walls were paneled and modern lights with hardwood floors were installed. A dining room, kitchen and restrooms were added along with Leslie speakers in the sanctuary.</p>
        
        <p>On January 27, 1980, the official opening and dedication of the J. H. Holmes Fellowship Hall was held. In June 1981 cushioned pews were installed. In 1985 the Church purchased the property for our main parking lot, and in 1987 the Church purchased the property adjacent to the building.</p>
        
        <p>In October 1991 the Church installed Central heating and air. In 1995 the Church got a face lift on the outside. The Church was painted, underpinning was completed and new gutters were installed. In 1999 the Church purchased a public address system and paid off the mortgage.</p>
        
        <p>Reverend Solomon Crenshaw, Sr. served this flock untiring for better than 49 years. But on October 27, 2009 God called his servant from labor to reward.</p>
        
        <h3>Reverend Truitt Evans Sr. Era (2010-2024)</h3>
        <p>In June 2010 a Pastor's search committee was selected and accepted by the Church. After going through the interview process with several applicants, it became clear that the person the Church needed was already on the pulpit. On March 13, 2011 Reverend Truitt Evans, Sr. was elected overwhelmingly by the Church membership to be the new Pastor.</p>
        
        <p>Under Rev. Evans' leadership the Church progressed well. A new air conditioning system and security system was installed. A new Church office was completed and the Pastor's study was renovated. This Church was also declared an Historical site.</p>
        
        <h3>Present Day - Pastor Rick Owens (2024-Present)</h3>
        <p>In September 2024, Reverend Rick (Rickey) Owens was promoted by God to be the new pastor of Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church, continuing our rich legacy of faithful ministry in Historic Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
