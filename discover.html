          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church has a rich heritage rooted in faith, community, and service. Our journey began in 1878 as Spring Street Baptist Church, and through God's providence, we found our permanent home in 1909 at our current location.</p>

              <h4>1878 - The Beginning</h4>
              <p>Spring Street Baptist Church was organized by faithful believers who gathered in a small frame house donated by Mr. Felix Mudd.</p>

            <div class="story-item">
              <h4>1909 - New Home</h4>
              <p>The church moved to its present location and was renamed Broad Street Missionary Baptist Church, using bricks donated from the old Elyton Courthouse.</p>

              <h4>1920-1958 - Growth & Development</h4>
              <p>Under Rev. J.H. Holmes' 38-year leadership, the church flourished with major renovations, new pews, carpet, and a Hammond organ installation.</p>
