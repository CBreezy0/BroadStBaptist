      <p>Students in grades 6â€“12 are invited to plug into a vibrant community built on faith, fun, and real talk. Our worship services mix live music, spoken word, and small-group discussions addressing the challenges teenagers face today. Throughout the year we host retreats, mission trips, and service days that help students grow closer to Christ and one another.</p>
